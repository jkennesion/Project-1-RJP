# Problem Statement for Project-1-RJP
For a medium sized fleet of a grounds maintenance company there is a robust methodology in use for creating a fuel use projection for the coming year.  However tyre costs fluctuate and previous budget projections have been inaccurate.  

“Can we use clustering to provide a model of a relationship between fuel costs and tyre costs for the previous year, which could be used to improve the budget projection for future tyre costs?”

For this exercise solely focus on fuel cost and tyre cost relationship.

For future exercises it would be possible to include other variables such as:

•	Total miles driven 

•	Driver speeding and safety scores

•	Historic weather conditions
